# Meditation-Your-Way-A1
My very first project!

Welcome!

This website is about Meditation! How to meditate and how to use Meditation to increase your productivity and to help you to live your best life! I created this Website in-order to give people information about Meditation to whoever wants to know, for free. I designed the information in such a way that shows people that they do not always have to sit somewhere comfortably to meditate. The Methods displayed on this Website, show you how to meditate while you are going through your daily activities. All you need to do is find moments through-out your day where you can be still and concentrate on your breathing.

I plan to add more information about living your best life, the importance of drinking clean Still Water & Water in general, Meditation Music and the healthy Music Frequencies that go along with the Music, when I have the time. I also did not have enough time to update the Styling for the Footer, the Navigation, the overall look of the Website, and fixing the problem with the Contact Form but I will do that later.
